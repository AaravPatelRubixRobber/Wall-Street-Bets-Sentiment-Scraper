# Wall-Street-Bets-Sentiment-Scraper

I made this project back in 2021 during the GME short-squeeze frenzy. This project scrapes posts from r/WallStreetBets to see which tickers are trending. The program uses NLP to calculate sentiment over time. This data is then graphed against stock movements to see if there is any relationship between the two.

SKILLS: Python, web scraping, NLP, data visualization
